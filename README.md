Full documentation will be pulished [here](https://community.intersystems.com/post/deploy-mldl-models-api-service-stacks)

### Note
Tensorflow exported models are ommited in the models directory, since they are **~250M** (larger than 100M by Github). I will upload these large files seperately.

The models are exported from Jupyter pipelines at [here](https://community.intersystems.com/post/run-some-covid-19-lung-x-ray-classification-and-ct-detection-demos) and [here](https://community.intersystems.com/post/explainability-and-visibility-covid-19-x-ray-classifiers-deep-learning)
